        <p>The user experience (UX) of an app or website is an itegral
         piece in the development process. At l-UX-e cookies (get it?) my goal is to
         create a site that provides the user with an experience that has drawn them in to 
         want to learn about us. So, if you're here, we've done our job.</p>

         <p>Did you ever unclear about what we are or how to find what you were looking for?
            Clear labeling made that possible. You always know where you are without being overwhelmed by
         a cluttered navigation bar. Thank you dropdown menu!</p>

            <p>Next, I created wireframe to mock up what the pages will look like. To simulate
                the experience, I built a wireflow to mimic the user's experience.
